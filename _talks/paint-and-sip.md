Join fellow Winterfest attendees for a fun painting experience. Talented instructor, Ann Thompson, will show you, step-by-step, how to take a blank canvas and create beautiful art prints upon it. This style of art prints is the same one used in the [**Nagasaki Tram 134 Student Art Block Project**](https://narcissus1912.blogspot.com/2019/08/1911-nagasaki-tram-no-134-renovation.html)
