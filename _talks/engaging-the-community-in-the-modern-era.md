In the early days of Trolley museums people attended because of a personal connection. Special events help connect the museum to the community. Special events create a multi-generational, emotional, connection. Can make connections to local social media groups and comment on the posts and link to blog posts. That interaction inspires donations of parts, maps, materials, all as a result of the social media connection.
