Join James van Bokkelen, leader of the Track team, on a journey through the adventure that was building the new **South Boston** car barn and the associated track. South Boston is so named because the switching track in front of it came from the South Boston Trolley barn. You can see the switching track first hand on the [Hidden Exhibits of Seashore](/talks/Hidden-Exhibits-of-Seashore/) tour.

_**This session speaks about `South Boston`, but the session takes place in the `Visitors Center Conference Room`**_
