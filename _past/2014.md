### February 14-15, 2014

As in years past, this event is intended for your active volunteers as opposed to your general membership. Of course, determining who gets invited is solely the discretion of your respective organizations.

It will be an exciting weekend in Rockhill Furnace and we are delighted to be the hosts of this year's event.

As you may know, each year the museums on the east coast gather together and enjoy a day of socializing, and trolley riding at a chosen museum. In 2014, the Rockhill Trolley Museum www.rockhilltrolley.org in Rockhill Furnace, PA will be hosting the event. While plans are not totally ready yet, we wanted to give you advance notice of the dates. The dates are February 14 & 15, a Friday afternoon and Saturday.
Plans are not finalized but we are hoping to have volunteers available to lead a Friday afternoon walking tour (proper footwear and clothing, please) of the East Broad Top Railroad right of way south of Rockhill Furnace towards Robertsdale. We’re hoping to stop at the high points on the narrow gauge line. The EBT has not seen a train operating over these parts of the line since 1956. We plan to have this tour occur at noon time departing from Rockhill Furnace. Friday evening we'll gather at the museum for a meal and then have a few evening trolley rides. Saturday morning we'll get started with trolley rides and guest operation with as many cars as we are able to operate from our collection. Signups will be on a first come first serve, limiting visitors to choices so everyone will be able to have a chance.

Once details are ready, we’ll send another note regarding meal reservations and times. Until then, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to let Matt Nawn mwntrolley@aol.com , Bill Monaghan TrolleyDriver@comcast.net or myself know and we’ll do our best to help you. We look forward to seeing you at the Rockhill Trolley Museum next February and we’ll get more details sent out as soon as we have them available
